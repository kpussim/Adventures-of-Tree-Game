# The Adventures of Tree Game
I attest that I did NOT use ChatGPT or any other automated writing system for ANY portion of this assignment.

## Summary
This is a game I created in my game development class in early 2024. It is a 2D Mario-styled game, played in the perspective of your character, Tree. With some enemies to avoid and several levels to get through, this may prove to be a bit of a challenge. Through the use of Unity and the programming language C#, I was able to create a couple of 2D maps for my character to run through and complete, filled with AI bots to avoid and portals into each realm. Each one of these levels have their own theme, and will get harder as you progress. Below are the screenshots of each level.

## How To Run Game
There is a link given in this project for the game. All that needs to be done to run it is for the link to be copied and pasted into Safari, Google, or whichever one you prefer. 
It can also be accessed through this link: [The Adventures of Tree](https://katrina-05.itch.io/the-adventures-of-tree)

## The Code
All the code was written through Visual Studio Code within Unity. Every object has its own file, and every function for an object can be easily found by looking through the respective file. I have uploaded the files into this project, so they can be accessed and looked at. For the main character controls, reference the Player Controller Script, and for the AI bots, refer to the AI bot scripts. Each one of those files has the exact code in C# for which I used for my game.

## Challenges/Learnings 
As this was one of my first projects, it was certainly challenging to learn and understand the code behind every action, and to put every piece of this game together. From drawing every enemy, my character, and the blocks in the world, to uploading them all into Unity and creating maps for these characters to run on, this was a challenge. Mainly, however, this was also roughly the first time I have ever used Unity and coded in C#, so this project was a massive learning curve for me. After successfuly completing this game, I went on to learn more complex techniques and ideas, and even started messing with 3D projects. As for my future goals, this can show my skills, not only in coding, but creativity to future employers. Game development is a field I'm interested in, so the skills and code shown in this can help begin to display my progress in the field. 

## Future Goals
It's been almost a year since this project has been made, and I believe with the experience I have now I can greatly improve this game. Firstly, the music can certainly be improved on so 2 levels won't have the same soundtrack. However mainly, from adding more levels, and more complex AI bots, to the possibility of new worlds and better graphics, this game can vastly improve from the basic 2D adventure that it is to a game that has less bugs, better movement, and better visuals.

## FAQs
Q: What are the controls?
A: Use A and D to move left and right, and Space to jump

Q: What do I have to avoid?
A: There are red falling spikes that you have to run past, and pink mushrooms that run to you and blue evil blocks that move left and right within a specific range that you have to jump over.

Q: When do I die?
A: You only die if you lose all 3 lives. There's a counter in the top left of the screen.

Q: How do I progress through the levels?
A: There is a rectangular shaped portal at the very end of each level that you must touch, so you can get teleported to the next level. In the very last level, the portal is circular indicating it is the final one. 

Q: How do I win?
A: To win, you must successfully complete all levels and reach the last portal without losing all 3 lives.
